        <b>**Note, these are personal raw thoughts that I thought of quite a while ago (not intended to be shared with people as of now but for a select few, I do plan on writing more formal essay's); I don't update this list anymore as I use something else and I probably have updated my thinking on many of the ideas below.</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Knowing how to think; a lot of it depends on early intuition (how you view the world) developed as a child along with people you are around, what you watch, etc.</li>
  <li>Knowing how to learn quick</li>
  <li>Free information but somehow, the creators still get paid? by definition of 'free', this sounds contradictory...</li>
  <li>Transmission of information without any medium, ie. ISP; truly P2P</li>
  <li>Key to breaking habits that you view are bad</li>
  <li>Power through technology, not politics; ie. patents, exclusive deals, etc. we are hackers (thinkers &amp; builders), not business people; &lt;-- Problem with this is, how will the creator get paid? 'Free information' for digital public goods sounds great &amp; it probably is the 'ideal' but revenue-models are far from optimal; &lt;-- Maybe 'cheap information' is better than free information? Or rather, public digital information will be free but you need other mediums to create revenue: ads (*I wonder if another implicit model like this exists?), enterprise software, etc.)  </li>
  <li>Hustle luck vs 'knowledge-based' luck (why pursuing something that is working in the short term may not be the optimal strategy); Platform creator vs early adaptor to a platform (difference between knowledge-based luck and hustle luck) --&gt; hustle luck makes for great movies/anecdotal stories but it's far from optimal and you generally want to avoid 'hustle-based games' (this goes for life in general; people view dating as a 'numbers-game' but that is completely wrong.. become someone where many women will be attracted you); so if you have to spend a ton of money on marketing early on, you probably have a bad product; (optimized strategy will never leverage a bad product) so technology should always be at the forefront; Word-of-mouth is the best metric but actually, an optimal metric is you just using the product everyday yourself; if your building something not for yourself, highly doubt you will make a good product... &lt;--this is where people mess up because they initially were building something cool for themselves but as soon as you get 'money/expectations', etc. it turns into satisfying users/investors/maximizing-revenue and this is the precursor to the downfall</li> 
  <li>^better incentive structures for scientific research?</li>
  <li>Are you trying to be a platform creator or a successful user/early-adaptor? (not necessarily bad thing to do the later but the former, although significantly harder is much more rewarding/valuable);  <b>I wonder if monetary incentives weren't in place on youtube, would people still contribute? </b></li>
  <li>Many over-optimize their thinking to hustle-based / zero-sum games; movies/school is probably the gensis for this but in reality, the best games are when its knowledge/thinking-based and win-win game</li>
  <li>Individual thinking (non-conforming; why is conforming so popular?) and understanding the abstractive game you are playing</li>
  <li>Developing learn drive; ways to measure understanding without grades?-- alternative mediums? --&gt; Read Alfie's books on this ** </li>
  <li>Harder doesn't necessarily mean better; Large companies doesn't necessarily mean better product or more efficiency; &lt;-- misconception that a key to scaling is hiring more employees to "ship features faster, etc."; partially true but I don't believe this is the whole truth(elaborate more); also, the idea that founder will not focus on code is BS (look at geohotz); you want to view it more like a researchlab rather than a company...</li> 
  <li>Effective hiring measures</li>
  <li>Constant meta-analyzing &amp; meta-awareness when thinking through problems; only way to continue improvement (recursive cycle)</li>
  <li>Routines are the not the optimal approach to measuring productivity 
   but key to building foundational discipline; foundational discipline is solid control over your desires (essentially your 'limbic brain' although this isn't the correct way to put it); Why do you need foundational discipline? To persist when things become hard or you no longer want to do something but you know it needs to get done; research is hard so foundational discipline becomes extremely important; another thing is seriously caring about the problem you are working on, almost like a 'unhealthy obsession' or like God put you on this earth to solve this problem... it's weird explaining this but this obsessive feeling is extremely important not only to solve the problem but to continue to solve other related problems! (many people fall off after they get money; there primary interest was money, not the problem)</li>
  <li>Solitude is necessary for great thinking; The hardest problems nature imposes on us are discovered by individual thinkers (of course they leverage the scientific community); they are not discovered by groups (very very rare); you could hypothesize group think is filtered to the lowest level of thought (&lt;-- phase this better; thinking of 'bad information is replaced by good information')</li> 
  <li>Over-emphasis on surrounding yourself with the right people; become the person that other people want to hang around</li>
  <li>idolizing someone is for the weak; learn from everyone, idolize no-one (idolizing implies they are better than you and you can't achieve what they achieved; this is foolish)</li>
  <li>Also good because you are viewing everyone as equal; exactly what you want to do</li>
  <li>important stuff to learn from others, especially people you consider 'smart' (whatever smart means... trying to figure this out) is their thinking models</li>
  
  <li>human nature never lies; vast majority (surprisingly including majority of your cousin-families as well) will smile in your face and tell you that you are doing good but deep down, resent everything you have; being a leader, you are constantly faced with this; the people will resent you and admire you at the same time, weird.</li>
  <li>Best people are those whose consciousness revolves on the pursuit of truth and constant self-awareness for important (in many aspects of their life but this goes more into viewing life as an optimization problem) </li>
  <li>Perhaps life is just a test of self-control; bringing all your desires under control (doesn't mean not pursuing them but their is a difference between mindless pursuit, ie. when something get's hard, go pursue some meaningless desire where you can waste an hour or two that brings ST-pleasure but makes you regret what you did afterwards; &amp; willingly pursuit) </li>
  
  <li>All action stems from thought; want to break a habit, clean your thoughts; ie. 'Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.'</li>
  <li>Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment</li>
  <li>Breaking bad habits starts with being proud of your 'daily wins'; to fulfill your long-term desires (your ideal), you need to be proud daily of the steps you are taking to get there; &lt;-- this is what is meant by 'enjoying the journey' because what you realize is, after you achieve the result (often it is followed by another objective which is completely fine), you found a lot more pleasure in the journey than the final result; hard to see from the beginning; </li>
  <li>Bad Habits will be neutralized by reverse habits; becoming extremely aware when those bad habits emerge and stopping them dead-center; &lt;-- this goes for all thoughts in the mind in general; think of it as a garden; do you want your garden to have beautiful flowers with solid soil/roots or do you want weeds? when you see weeds in a garden, you remove them; the same is true for your thoughts; remove all trivial thoughts (many of them have been removed; few that are left are putting myself down when faced with a bug or problem I can't solve followed by I need to solve this now, or I am going to stay up all night to solve this or look how much more work needs to be done...; another is comparison to others, especially researchers in my field, constantly looking at their sites to feel anxiety, envy, stupid emotions; and last is lust; lust is rare at the moment from direct craving for it but rather, it is a precursor usually from, 'oh I went 4 days, man can I continue?', or when a challenge (bug, tough problem) appears, giving into the lust desire to waste time) &lt;-- You have become aware of these and you must continue to become aware of these and just like in the garden example, you must immediately stop them ** </li>
  <li>Virtue Signalling or morality-preaching is that of the weak; people are view themselves as constantly being oppressed are the weakest of all and resort to morality/virtue-preaching; they can't admit their lack of discipline... truly is narcissism in full-effect </li>
  <li>knowledge workers vs other stuff; &lt;-- need to abstract, think and write about this; will be interesting; especially in relation to usefulness, both monetary, social, etc. </li>
  <li>Managing the thinking (reading, forming abstractions, etc.) vs. actual project-creation; &lt;-- need to balance the two </li>
  <li>^ for above, it's a mix between moving slow and fast</li>
  <li>Reading has it's own use cases; some use it for entertainment, others use it to filter/find the best books in particular domains and re-read those books over and over again; I am right now using reading as a medium to solve problems that I am interested in; I don't necessarily read to remember an individual's thoughts or rank-order books in a particular domain (atleast explicitly but implicitly I am sure this happens) but rather, think through ideas presented in the book in relation to the problem I am working on &amp; my ideas... For understanding a particular domain, solving a problem seems to be an interesting approach and thus, you would probably use my type of reading-model</li>
  <li>Tinkering is an amazing thing to do; Not tinkering with software/hardware and pursuing your (rebellious)-creativity is a major mistake</li>
  <li>A key thing with the way I approach research is make sure you do read through quite a lot (not necessarily that big on re-implementation unless you really like some approach and plan on using it for your own research) but the key is, using your own thoughts (correct thinking models) combined with readings (taking your time understanding papers, skimming through and reading important parts of textbooks, listening to an interview by the researcher, etc.) &lt;-- this is fundamental in shaping your thinking for the project but you don't want to solely rely on your intuition nor do you want to let others dictate your research path as you want to let your intuition do that (which will constantly be revised/improved through readings &amp; further thinkings); your intuition is guiding your path through the problem which also dictates what you should be reading, which papers/ideas to focus on, etc. rather than letting the 'community' decide your path; your intuition will be built abstractively by the problem you are focusing on (which is why constantly revising the abstractive problem &amp; reformulation is critical) </li>
  <li>Solve stuff your interested in or stuff that is bothering you personally; If it is 'big', you can break it down into smaller steps but don't let anyone stop you from working on any problem, 'big or small' as both are useful to you and others in their own right; it's foolish to follow the common belief that a 'beginner researcher' should read other people's papers and look at ways to slightly improve their methods so they can 'publish more papers'; this is a great way into conformity...; let your intuition guide your problems, big or small, but you obviously need to watch for grandiosity (this is why self-awareness is critical in thinking domains); If Einstein/Newton/Turing listened to their advice, they probably would be 30 before doing their own work </li>
  <li>To me, a better word would be a thinker, inventor, problem-solver, hacker than a 'researcher'; To me, Einstein/Newton/DiVinci/Tesla, etc. weren't necessarily 'researchers', they were brilliant thinkers (one can go on about abstractive qualities in brilliant thinkers but core is, they let their own curiosity/intuition guide them in the pursuit of the truth; &lt;-- corrupt thinking models, etc. can be mentioned here) </li>
  <li>"Listening to your users" --&gt; need to be extremely careful with this advice as it implies that you should listen and prioritize their requests or your own intuition; the stuff I wrote about research can be abstracted here; you want to listen to your own thoughts/ideas first while still understanding user behavior/requests; but too much of one or the other is terrible; also, the 'releasing early' advice needs to be carefully applied to: release too early and you prematurely let others interfere with your 'speculative projects'. release too late and you might have built something that is too complicated for anyone else to use or understand (intuitively, you should know when too release)</li>
  <li>'Re-read the best 100 books over and over again' is also advice that should be carefully handled; it forgoes new potential entities; there is a reason no one says, 're-read the best 100 papers over and over again'; this all depends on your use case or abstractively, the game you are on (again, formulating the initial game/problem is not just fundamental in research but in life)</li>
  <li>A true thinker is one who is after the truth; nothing else matters.</li>
  <li>I choose to think on my own in a world where majority will conform to others; I choose to take action on my thoughts in a world where majority choose to do nothing; I choose to forgo all personal desires in the pursuit of solving my problem while others are slaves to their desires.</li>
  <li>You can see when one is a slave to his own desires; It shows all over their face; they are living in an existential vacuum;</li>
  <li>The philosopher Democritus put out his eyes so that, ceasing to read, he might think. Learning to think by reading is like learning to draw by tracing. In each case, we make the work of another man our basis, instead of observing directly from Nature. </li>
  <li>A man should read only when his thoughts stagnate at their source, which will happen often enough even with the best of minds. On the other hand, to take up a book for the purpose of scaring away one's own original thoughts is a sin against the Holy Spirit. It is like running away from Nature to look at a museum of dried plants, or gaze at a landscape in copperplate. </li>
  <li><b>The next abstraction of programmability will be humans (genetic engineering); Current abstraction I will reach is communicating with computers (&amp; the web) at a linguistic level (like we do with humans)</b></li>
  <li>** A habit is not broken through repetitive thinking about not doing the habit; this is as unproductive as doing the habit; it is when you divert your thought into your work and execute; really, your mind does not want to work, so it resorts to the most pleasurable thing, then the less pleasurable thing that is easier than you want to actually do, etc.; Key to breaking all this is becoming obsessive in your projects and building out the stuff you want to build... same way in the gym when you do the last rep or set past the point of pain, you have to proceed to working and ignore that part that wants to stop; this way, what your diminishing is your brain's desire to not work (it will never completely go away but it will be diminished as it won't be long until you start seeing results from your work and this creates a dopamine loop) and as a byproduct, you break all your bad habits</li>
  <li>I think for me, cards would be better to quickly write/iterate on informal stuff (non research-related) that I think about without having to formally write an essay or blogpost; quick medium to let out some stuff that I thinking about on the side; I think this also creates a unique incentive system to constantly meta-rationalize or be meta-aware of more than just the problem in front of you</li>
  <li>Cards would also be extremely powerful for my research; I essentially do this already with my hand-written but with cards, they would be even more effective as I can interfacilitate very quickly with OS/web and potential for AI-dsicovery/recommendation</li>
  <li>One thing that breeds into constant thinking of habit is explicit restriction; I am no longer doing this; It is a balance, the best way is a natural transition where your mind no longer wants to pursue (or rarely) those activities... limiting (**and seriously sticking to the limiting 'routine') leads to eventual removal; </li>
  <li>The most important part of solving a problem is understanding how to formulate the problem; formulating the problem will guide you in your solution space but also, guide your creativity for future improvements; always be aware of problem formulation</li>
  <li>I need to solve at least the problems I view as most important or else, regardless of my thoughts, if I don't execute, it is all for nothing; might as well not pursue it if you don't want to execute on it</li>
  <li>Don't fool yourself into thinking you are smart, etc., very easy to do when you are a solitude thinker; learn from everyone and pursue the truth (ie. solve the problems you are interested in); inhibit all other thinking models that get in the way of this</li>
  <li>How does one effectively understand something? &lt;--This question can be important for building an AI I want </li>
  <li>Sleep is over-rated; One can think quite well with little sleep; Focus so obsessively on your thoughts and execution of projects that sleep is forgotten</li>
  <li>formalism is overrated</li>
  <li>Thinking of stuff is easy; Execution is the hard part; Soon, execution will become easier but a thinker needs to constantly make decisions on which project to spend time on, which to ignore; this is tough on me but I hope I can get better</li>
  <li>Crazy how I am now, at 24, working on the problems that I was facing/thinking about at 19-20; sad I didn't pursue this a lot earlier but (attitude reshaping is like conscious problem reformulation) like they say, better now than never...</li>
  <li>Vast majority of 'society' is 'stupid' (not in the intelligence sense, will expand on this further) so what makes you think societal truths or even worse, websites that society views as popular (pagerank) would be any good; relates to the law that, bad information filters its way to the top (same way as bad money filters out good money)</li>
  <li>Intelligence has a lot to do with finding abstractions/generalizations quickly (either implicitly/explicitly); this is why thinking hard on problems you are working on is so critical</li>
  <li>Marginal cost: cost of consuming a bit more of something; Marginal benefit: the benefit received from consuming a bit more something; (ie. donuts are a good example); many assume the cost of consuming digital information is 0; in practical $, this is true but you should also factor in your theoretical time-cost; &lt;-- This is what has lead me to the reading approach I use rather than constantly reading various books that aren't directly related to a problem I am working on; The reading approach mentioned above actually allows one to use the information stored in ST-memory towards solving a specific problem leading to more effective consolidation in LT-memory (deeply thinking about the information consumed) rather than merely reading for the sake of remembering another person's ideas on some topic or even worse, trying to 'sound smart' (not going down that rabbit hole) --&gt; related to supermemo's ideas of incremental reading/writing: https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading / https://www.super-memory.com/archive/help16/write.htm ; "Incremental writing involves: (1) writing, (2) review, (3) learning, and (4) creative elaboration. All those processes are derived from incremental reading, however, the focus shifts freely from learning to creativity to problem solving, and back."</li>
  <li>Teenagers or young people are most optimal to solve the toughest problems: they are naive, high-energy, rebellious (combined with personal/social pressure to 'become something') </li>
  <li>Unfortunately from a monetary perspective, deep individualistic thinkers provide the most value for society but capture next to none for themselves; 'fast-thinkers' or business people like Elon or politicians like Trump are ones who are very good at finding the right people to work on problems (some, Elon included, also do engage in some effort on the thinking and invest time in the direction the team is taking to solving the problem but he is not the one actually doing the core thinking) capture quite a lot of economic value; a society needs both types (you need horizontal innovation along with vertical) but vertical, or rather public-goods (I believe 'most' but I will think about this more vertical innovations end up becoming public goods) is poorly incentivized economically &lt;-- <b>Hopefully I can fix this</b> I hope the future of 'companies' and what it means to be a 'company' looks a lot different than what it is currently </li>
  <li>We want associate pain, especially physical pain with value/success; (even for innovation, ie. no sleep) probably from movies &amp; terrible schooling &lt;-- do the opposite; (real innovation process would make a terrible movie); Urgency is critical to solving a problem efficiently and that usually does require less sleep for some periods of time but in reality, vast majority of the greatest thinkers never neglected sleep; they optimized and refined their sleep the same way they optimized and refined their thinking models... work with your body so it rewards you with clear thoughts, novel associations, etc. and not against it (that is a misapplication of discipline) </li>
  <li>If within t minutes of meeting you, a person asks what 'school' you want to or what is your degree, ignore them or play dumb; you can tell the success of a company by looking at their hiring page</li>
  <li>What boggles my mind is people who will list and explain problems but offer trivial or solutions that can be disproven with a days worth of thinking (everyone knows education sucks yet everyone accepts it) </li>
  <li>Interfacilitate between slow and fast thinking; &lt;-- something you need to develop, quite easy, just new so it takes a couple of days</li>
  <li>
  Education system built solely of solving problems you are interested in 
  - This is how I started to learn programming (largely tried inhibiting it because I thought I was doing it wrong) but at first, you may start with personal small problems that don’t necessarily have a ‘large value’ to others but eventually, the problems can start to become more and more valuable (problem valuation network); obviously another emphasis will be awareness of ones thinking models and other stuff mentioned above</li> 
  <li>A good way to grasp an understanding of something; Read way back to the original proposals of the inventors, understand the era they were in, read the citations they were reading, read counter-opposing ideas to their work (ie. Tim's work vs. Xanadu) as this will truly allow you to understand the 'problem-space', what it is you are currently looking at, and give you much better idea of which directions to look into (improve your intuition); &lt;-- This is the critical learning one should definitely undertake in a problem they are interested ('school', whatever that looks like can be of benefit here)</li> 
  <li>Novel thinking models; most important thing in 'knowledge-type work' is what you think (controlled by your environment and your own awareness) and how you think &lt;-- this idea of 'how you think' implies you can 'change your thinking'; I wonder how this relates to the idea conceptual/mental computation &lt;-- need to read that further</li> 
  <li>'future employees' are those type that help contribute to projects, ie. the creation of the world wide web, or web3, etc.; they are interested in other people's projects and start working on them and receive monetary compensation for their work... (&lt;-- need to figure out a good monetary/social incentive structure) </li> 
  <li>Patience with yourself is key; not being patient in learning leads to anxiety and terrible emotions which is a precursor to terrible thinking models; attitude is everything</li> 
  <li>Why was the period of the renaissance filled with so much innovation? How was schooling like during that time? Was it the printing press? Books also became really cheap and reading with 'democratized'; Why was there so much physical violence in early history and not so much now? What were the universities like? How about communication, society functioning, basic economics, jobs?</li> 
  <li>** Need to study the history of the printing press, how does a printer work, how has computer/internet sort of replaced this idea of a printing press &lt;-- think about this stuff from various levels of abstractions --&gt; look into guttenburg; printing press served as a vehicle for the mass dissemination of opinion</li> 
  <li>Architecture is a massive failure (from technological POV)...</li> 
  
  <li>Not letting your mind go to trivial thoughts, say when you are programming, or doing a relatively routinized-task; ** Be aware of this; (easier when there is no music) and switch your thoughts to the problems you are working on... &lt;-- you can actually continue to make progress on those problems and update notes while programming on another problem </li> 
  <li>Price's law can also be applied for the creativity and problem-solving ability of people; more people, the worse it gets</li> 
  <li> This idea that you need to be rich (need money) or older/mature to solve some of the really hard problems or solve problems period is absurd; Or even the idea you need a ‘team’ of people (a large team is not solving any serious problem, period; the larger the team, the more trivial the company’s thoughts/outputs) &lt;-- Xerox PARC/Bell-labs/original mac team seems to be an exception to this; wonder why?</li> 
  <li>“surround yourself with ‘smart’ people and focus on the problems they are working on” &lt;— beyond stupid advice; focus on problems you are interested in and work on those (you will find other ‘smart’ people who are also interested in those problems…)
  </li> 
  <li> true learn drive should be independent of money</li> 
  
  <li>thinking about and understanding the concepts between ideas, frameworks, protocols, etc. is much more important than understand how to use it
      - Thinking about the original vision of the internet, what the internet is today, (comparing it to historical communication mediums, etc.) 
      - Thinking about the computer, digital vs. Mechanical/analog, etc. </li> 
  <li>theoretical progress (ie. research) may be a byproduct of practical progress/problem-solving; might be much more effective to focus on the latter, breaking down problems, while still maintaining the original problem focus map persistent </li> 
  <li>Grandiosity is a dangerous drug; should be avoided at all costs as it provides nothing useful </li> 
  <li>Sure, what something is and how it works/how to use it is important but understanding why something was created &amp; how it was created (along with historical explorations of others similar stuff at the time, counter-opposing ideas, etc.) is the most important</li> 
  <li>The ability to want to improve (humility, learner's mentality and rigorous meta-awareness, curiosity and irreverence) &lt;-- 'Correct consciousness to have to solve difficult problems' (vast majority don't have this; they are stuck on false-delusions and grandiosity) </li> 
  <li>Excitement is one of those emotions like grandiosity; you need to be very careful with this emotion; it is good to be excited about your projects (especially initial excitement) but excitement can delude thinking (just like grandiosity); it can also lead to the opposite emotion, disappointment, when things are not going well; better to remain neutral and detached from the problem; think of it as something you have to solve and focus only on the problem, ignoring emotions/yourself all together</li> 
  <li>Inaction is the precursor to everything; &lt;-- Don't fall into inaction or stale thinking; follow your routine as is, period.</li> 
  <li>** Morning thoughts (when you wake up) are extremely important: &lt;-- The morning should entail in thinking of the problem; This should be the only focus</li> 
  <li>The key is detachment from your work; When you detach form your work, you disassociate yourself (ego); this results in lack of grandiosity but also lack of negative emotions (overwhelming, jealousy, etc.); key to making continuous progress on a problem</li> 
  <li>A simple solution is the best one; don't think hard equals more valuable </li> 
  <li>Habits don't exist; (hence, my above thoughts/ideas on habits are completely wrong). It is an illusion predicated by the mind and further exacerbated society. More abstractively, all of neuroscience does not exist, I will fix this. (also, I was prematurely influenced by Hebb/Edelman's ideas of the brain and more specifically, the overwhelming empiricist point of view... All wrong, working on fixing this starting with the NLP project</li> 
  <li>Qualia? An illusion or a learning necessity? My genesis project will let me know</li> 
  <li>We will create a new species (simulation) before we ever find one; (computational proof that we (most probably) are in a simulation)</li> 
  <li>Hackthebox challenges are amazing; </li>
  <li>"Self-control is strength. Right thought is mastery. Calmness is power. Self-respect is a byproduct. Happiness is a byproduct of self-respect."</li>
