          “you must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?”

          If you have to spend a ton of money on marketing early on, you probably have a bad product (or its not a tech company); 
          Optimized strategy will never leverage a bad product) so technology should always be at the forefront; 
          Word-of-mouth is the best metric but actually, an optimal metric is you just using the product everyday yourself; 
          if your building something not for yourself, highly doubt you will make a good product... <--this is where 
          people mess up because they initially were building something cool for themselves but as soon as you get 
          'money/expectations', etc. it turns into satisfying users/investors/maximizing-revenue and this is the precursor to the downfall         
        </li>

        <li>  
          Solitude is where greatness is born. Be very careful who/what you allow into your conscious. 
          Best people are those whose consciousness revolves on the pursuit of truth and they inhibit everything else in the way 
          of that pursuit.
        </li>

        <li>  
          "Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. 
          When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food."
        </li>
        
        <li> 
          "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."         
        </li>
        
        <li>   
          "Listening to your users" --> need to be extremely careful with this advice as it implies that you should listen and 
          prioritize their requests or your own intuition; the stuff I wrote about research can be abstracted here; you want to 
          listen to your own thoughts/ideas first while still understanding user behavior/requests; but too much of one or the other 
          is terrible; also, the 'releasing early' advice needs to be carefully applied to: release too early and you prematurely 
          let others interfere with your 'speculative projects'. release too late and you might have built something that is too 
          complicated for anyone else to use or understand (intuitively, you should know when too release); However, vast majority of people 
          release too late (currently as I am writing this, I realized that I am guilty of this the most; I tend to overthink everything
          which is a terrible thinking model especially for engineering. You need to break problems down iteratively, an 'optimal solution' does not exist.)

        </li>
        
        <li> 
          'Re-read the best 100 books over and over again' is also advice that should be carefully handled; it forgoes new potential entities; there is a reason no one says, 're-read the best 100 papers over and over again'; this all depends on your use case or abstractively, the game you are on (again, formulating the initial game/problem is not just fundamental in research but in life)

        <li>  
          " Learning to think by reading is like learning to draw by tracing. In each case, we make the work of another man our basis, instead of observing directly from Nature."
