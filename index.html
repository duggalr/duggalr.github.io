      <a href="https://github.com/duggalr">github</a>
      <p>Currently working on building a conversational assistant.</p>
      <p>Will expand on these <a href="raw_thoughts.html">thoughts</a> shortly (don't take these seriously)</p>
      
      <p>
        Your work is your responsibility, not its result. <br/>
        Never let the fruits of your actions be your motive. <br/>
        Nor give in to inaction. <br/>
        Set firmly in yourself, do your work, not attached to anything. <br/>
        Remain evenminded in success, and in failure. <br/>
        Even mindedness is true yoga. <br/>
        <strong>â€”Bhagavad Gita, 2.47-49</strong>
