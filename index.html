      <p>I hid personal thoughts I put up a while ago but I will probably make some formal blog posts shortly</p>
      
      <p>
        Your work is your responsibility,not its result. <br/>
        Never let the fruits of your actionsbe your motive. <br/>
        Nor give in to inaction. <br/>
        Set firmly in yourself, do your work,not attached to anything. <br/>
        Remain evenminded in success,and in failure. <br/>
        Evenmindedness is true yoga. <br/>
        <strong>â€”Bhagavad Gita, 2.47-49</strong>
